# StorageSwarm: Decentralized Encrypted Cloud Storage

## Project Overview

StorageSwarm is a peer-to-peer, decentralized cloud storage solution built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The platform provides secure, encrypted file storage with incentivized participation for storage providers.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Storage**: Files are distributed across a network of storage providers
- **Encryption**: Each file is encrypted before storage
- **Incentive Mechanism**: Storage providers are rewarded for maintaining files
- **Transparent Reputation System**: Providers build reputation through successful storage operations

## Smart Contract Capabilities

### File Upload
- Maximum file size: 100 MB
- Unique file identification via SHA-256 hash
- Encryption key management
- Storage fee calculation

### Storage Provider Management
- Provider registration
- Reputation tracking
- Reward mechanism for reliable storage

## Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Bitcoin Layer)
- **Smart Contract Language**: Clarity
- **Encryption**: File-level encryption before storage
- **Consensus**: Provider reputation and fee-based model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks Wallet
- Basic understanding of decentralized storage concepts

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Deploy the Clarity smart contract to Stacks testnet/mainnet
3. Integrate with a frontend storage client

## Security Considerations

- Files are encrypted before upload
- Decentralized storage reduces single point of failure
- Reputation system discourages malicious behavior

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement file retrieval mechanism
- [ ] Add multi-signature file access
- [ ] Develop frontend storage client
- [ ] Implement advanced reputation scoring
